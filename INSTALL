NOTE: 

  mod_perl 1.99_10 (the current CVS version) is required for 
  this module to work as expected.

  additionally, apache 2.1 (the current experimental version
  from CVS, not -r APACHE_2_0_BRANCH) is also required for
  this module to work as expected.

  even with both of those, there are no guarantees and it 
  still might not work.  

  you can get the recent CVS sources via

    $ cvs -d":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic" checkout modperl-2.0
    $ cvs -d":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic" checkout httpd-2.0

  see 

    http://perl.apache.org/contribute/cvs_howto.html
    http://httpd.apache.org/dev/anoncvs.txt

  for detailed instructions on how to use apache.org's anonymous CVS 

  you can also get recent CVS snapshots at

    http://cvs.apache.org/snapshots/modperl-2.0/

INSTALLATION:

this module follows the standard 

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

routine.

if you want to run the tests, you'll need to do something similar
to the following

  $ export APACHE=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd
  $ export APXS=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
  $ make test

whether you choose to specify httpd or apxs depends on whether
or not your installation is has mod_so, so you may need one or
the other or both.

you can also configure the test suite when building the Makefile

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

run 

  $ t/TEST -help 

or see the README in the Apache-Test distribtion for more options

of course, this module is made to run under Apache 2.1 and mod_perl
2.0 so you'll need those as well, again preferably recent copies
complied from CVS.  Perl 5.8.0 is also a good idea.

have fun.
